## Getting started :


## Troubleshooting :
- **Error when building the program "unresolved external symbol" and "library machine type 'X86' conflicts with target machine type"**
Check that the sqlite.dll file is at the root of the project and that you build the project in x86 platform. (It doesn't work yet on x64)

##Brief description :
This program emulates that of commercial movie reservation systems like cgv.co.kr or lottecinema.co.kr.
Some basic features include: signup, login, movie search, movie reservation/reservation cancellation, movie rating, etc.
It has a GUI so users can use the program with ease.
